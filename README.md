# VLCB Documents
This repository contains published specifications and documents for VLCB, **Versatile Layout Control Bus**.  

VLCB is an effort to complete the documentation and specification of CBUS(tm) 
so that developers and users can have a definitive set of documents describing 
the system in a complete and accurate manner. 
Note that DCC protocols are not currently covered in this release and will be added in a later release.

VLCB documents describe this Local Control Bus in terms of a base specification, 
the Minimum Node Specification, 
and a set of optional Services, each with its own specification document.
Most application modules should be able to be formed by combining these specifications,
and adding additional application code. 

These specifications will be updated as additional requirements are identified.
