The specifications and documents for VLCB

VLCB is an effort to complete the documentation and specification of CBUS(tm), so that developers and users can have a definitive set of documents describing the system in a complete and accurate manner. 
Note that transport protocols are not covered in these documents -- ie DCC Train control.
