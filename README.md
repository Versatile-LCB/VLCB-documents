The specifications and documents for VLCB

This repository holds the documents describing the Versatile Local Control Bus.  

VLCB documents describe this Local Control Bus in terms of a base specification, the Minimum Node Specification, and a set of optional Services, each with its own specification document.  Most application modules should be able to be formed by combining these specifications, and adding additional application code. 

These specifications will be updated as additional requirements are identified.
